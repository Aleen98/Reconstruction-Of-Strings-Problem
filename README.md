### The Reconstruction Problem: maximal size of intersection between two l-balls with radius 1

The Levenshtein distance between  two  words x and y, denoted by dL(x,y), is the minimum number of insertions and deletions to convert x to y.
The l distance between two words x and y of the same length, denoted by dl(x,y), is one half the Levenshtein distance, i.e.,dl(x,y) =dL(x,y)/2.
The radius-r l-ball of a length-n word x is the set Bl(x;r){ y| dl(x,y)<=r}.

with a given string length-n, calculating the maximal size of intersection between two l-balls with radius 1, is denoted by x and y which dl(x,y)=1
