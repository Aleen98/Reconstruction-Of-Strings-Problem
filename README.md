# The Reconstruction Problem: 
## maximal size of intersection between two _l_-balls with radius 1

The Levenshtein distance between  two  words x and y, denoted by _dL(x,y)_
, is the minimum number of insertions and deletions to convert _x_ to _y_.
The _l_ distance between two words _x_ and _y_ of the same length, denoted by _dl(x,y)_, is one half the Levenshtein distance, i.e.,_dl(x,y) =dL(x,y)/2_.
The radius-_r_ _l_-ball of a length-_n_ word x is the set *Bl(x;r){ y| dl(x,y)<=r}*.

with a given string length-_n_, calculating the maximal size of intersection between two _l_-balls with radius _1_, is denoted by _x_ and _y_ which _dl(x,y)=1_
